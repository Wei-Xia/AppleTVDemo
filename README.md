You will have to set up a local server in order to run this app

Using Terminal 
- cd to PROJECT_DIR/server 
- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

(**NOTE:** you will have to restart server after switching branches)

**Development progress branches:**

- step1: Pure client-server app example
- step2: App that starts with native UIViewController and then presents TVApplicationController on "Episodes" button press via injection of JS code
- step3: Introduces "Cast" button in TVApplicationController that pushes native UIViewController via injection of Swift code
- step4: Example of Images, that adjust to focus inside collection view cells in "Cast" screen
- step5: Introduces UIFocusGuide class, that helps moving focus diagonally from first cell to "Learn more" button
- step6: Example of animation performed in the middle of focus change in Cast screen
- step7: Example of TVServices extension, Top Shelf in a home screen and parallax app icon
